# Library-for-Entropy-Calculations
A library of functions for calculating different properties obtained with the simulation tool UppASD.

Tool for my master thesis "Comparison of Methods for Characterization of Magnetocaloric Materials" in physics. Code is commented but not documented yet, since it is still changing while I am working on the thesis. Documentation will be available after thesis is finished.
